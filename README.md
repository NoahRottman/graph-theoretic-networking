# graph-theoretic-networking
This project models professional networking as a graph optimization problem. The goal is to maximize two-hop reach under a limited connection budget.

Key ideas:
- Two-hop reach as an objective function
- Maximum coverage formulation
- Comparison of degree-based vs greedy strategies
- Simulations on scale-free and community-structured graphs

This began as a personal observation during a job search and evolved into an applied network science case study.

PDF write-up included.
